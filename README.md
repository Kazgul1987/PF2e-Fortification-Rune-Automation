# PF2e Fortification Rune Automation

This module automates the effects of the Fortification and Greater Fortification runes for Pathfinder 2e in Foundry VTT (compatible with Foundry V13).

When a character with an equipped Fortification rune is critically hit, the module posts a chat message containing a button to roll the appropriate flat check. The DC is 17 for a normal Fortification rune and 14 for a Greater Fortification rune. If the roll succeeds, the critical hit is treated as a normal hit.

## Installation
Add the module manifest URL to Foundry VTT and enable the module in your world. No further configuration is required.

## Usage
Simply play the game as normal. Whenever a token with a Fortification rune is struck with a critical hit, a button will appear in chat prompting the defender to roll the flat check.
